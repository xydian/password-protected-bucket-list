## Try it out

I didn't upload the app to the app store/play store. But I published it on Expo. If you have an Android device you just need to download the [Expo App](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=host.exp.exponent&hl=de) from the play store and scan the following QR-code. Due to restrictions imposed by Apple in it's App Store this is not possible using an IPhone. You need to run the app locally using the expo-cli and connect it with your IPhone. As I don't have an IPhone i can't tell you the exact steps to do it. 
Otherwise you could also use an Android Emulator. If you need help setting it up, let me know.
